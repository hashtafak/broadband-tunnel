# broadband-tunnel
 Expose your local ports with popular services via Private Message ;)

# WHAT
- Expose any port on your local computer via many popular Tunnel Service (free only, yep)
- In your pocket/smartphone: Control with IM (Telegram, Discord, ...)
- Load-balanced/fails over is ready.
- Single-short-session only: never do long-time sessions to protect yourself

# WHEN
- I realize that I can not use Anydesk/Teamviewer/Ultraviewer on my Virtualbox Windows with smooth control. Because it needs Hardware to render graphic.
- Remote Desktop Connection is good, they do graphic rendering via guest computer, not host computer. And the connection speed of Ngrok is good too! But random disconnect after a few minutes.

# WHY
- I also want to do this method with my smartphone whenever I want via IM.
